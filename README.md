1. Research Mortgage Rate Sources: Begin by exploring reliable sources of mortgage rate data. Look for reputable financial institutions, government agencies, and financial data providers that offer historical and real-time mortgage rate information. Ensure that the data sources you select are accurate, up-to-date, and cover the specific mortgage types (such as 7-year ARM, 10-year ARM, 15-year fixed-rate, and 30-year fixed-rate mortgages).

2. Develop a Data Extraction Plan: Once you have identified suitable data sources, create a plan outlining the steps and techniques required to extract the mortgage rate data. Consider using web scraping tools, APIs, or any other relevant methods to retrieve the necessary information. 

3. Design User Interface (UI): Create an intuitive and user-friendly UI. Pay attention to layout, color schemes, and interactive elements that enhance the overall user experience. Keep in mind that the dashboard should allow users to explore the data, filter results based on specific criteria (e.g., mortgage type, time period), and provide relevant insights. Consider options such as D3.js, GUI , etc.

4. Document Your Process: Throughout the project, document the steps you take, including data source details, extraction methods employed, and any transformations or cleaning processes applied. This documentation will prove valuable for future reference and help streamline similar tasks in the future.
